# ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Nik!

I'm a full-stack software engineer with a specialization in the front-end, and in my current position I am working as a web designer/web developer. Through my current position and my side projects, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of what it takes - both aesthetically and functionally - to create an app or website that offers an amazing user experience. 

My contributions chart is noticeably empty over the last year, which is due to the large collaborative side project I've been working on over the last year living on gitlab. We are very excited to be so close to finishing and I will post a link to the final app here as soon as we have launched! I am personally very excited as this has been the first opportunity I have had to utilize the full range of my design and development skills to create an enterprise level website and application, and to do so with others.
